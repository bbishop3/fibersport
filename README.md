# fibersport app

Overview:
An application for FiberSport Poles to keep track of inventory and location of poles

Resources Used:
This project will be created with Flutter and the Dart programming language. It will start as a mobile application for iOS devices, but it will then expand to android, desktop, and web. I will be using VS Code IDE for development with the Flutter extention. 

Description:
This application will be used as a way for the business owner and associates to keep track of the inventory of poles and also the loction of said poles. Users will be able to list the poles currently in stock as individual objects. Each pole will be assigned to a location (FS warehouse, BVC, Vestavia, Homewood, etc.) when rented or unrented. Rented poles will also be given a time length describing how long that specific pole will be in that location (poles in FS warehouse will have "null" for this variable). Users will be able to add new poles as a new object in the application. Poles will be organized/stacked by pole length. 

UI Design: 
This application will have a modern and simplistic feel, and it will be very user friendly. I'm limiting the number of user interactions to increase usability (the fewer buttons, the better) 

Feature ideas:
-missing/broken poles
